# Hayhooks

**Hayhooks** makes it easy to deploy and serve [Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/) [Pipelines](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/pipelines) and [Agents](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/agents).

With Hayhooks, you can:

- üì¶ **Deploy your Haystack pipelines and agents as REST APIs** with maximum flexibility and minimal boilerplate code.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Expose your Haystack pipelines and agents over the MCP protocol**, making them available as tools in AI dev environments like [Cursor](https://cursor.com) or [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download). Under the hood, Hayhooks runs as an [MCP Server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture), exposing each pipeline and agent as an [MCP Tool](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools).
- üí¨ **Integrate your Haystack pipelines and agents with [open-webui](https://openwebui.com)** as OpenAI-compatible chat completion backends with streaming support.
- üïπÔ∏è **Control Hayhooks core API endpoints through chat** - deploy, undeploy, list, or run Haystack pipelines and agents by chatting with [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), [Cursor](https://cursor.com), or any other MCP client.
