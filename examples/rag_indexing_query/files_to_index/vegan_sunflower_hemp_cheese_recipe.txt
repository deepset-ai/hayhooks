Ingredients:


* ½ cup sunflower seeds
* ½ cup hemp hearts
* 1.5 teaspoons miso paste
* 1 tsp nutritional yeast
* ¼ cup rejuvelac*
* 1/4th teaspoon salt, or to taste


Soak the sunflower seeds in water overnight, OR boil them for 15 minutes. No need to soak the hempseeds, they’re cool like that.


Blend all ingredients in a blender or food processor. Blenders will get the nuts smoother but if you don’t have one, do what you’ve gotta do.


Put the mixture in a clean glass bowl. Cover it with a dish towel and secure with a rubber band. This lets air in but keeps bugs out. Keep it somewhere at room temperature but not in direct sunlight.


Culture the cheese for 24-48 hours. It will get tangier over time, but what does that mean exactly? It should taste kinda pleasantly sour like sourdough bread. If it tastes overly “yeasty” or “off” or develops mold, it’s bad and you should feel bad. Just kidding! It happens, throw it away and start over. 


Once the cheese is done culturing, taste and adjust salt. You can add additional flavorings at this step if you want to. More miso, nooch, artichoke hearts...the sky is the limit, really. 


The cheese will keep for ~2 weeks in the fridge wrapped in plastic. It  continues to get tangier in the fridge, just more slowly. It keeps in the freezer for idk, maybe a couple of months? If you try freezing it, let me know. 


*You can buy rejuvelac at your local co-op. Probably. Hopefully! If not, you can make it, if you’re one of those Ina Garten type vegans. But I haven’t had the patience to try, tbh. I’ve also heard that kombucha or sauerkraut liquid can work in a pinch, but YOLO.
